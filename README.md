# A LINK TO TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION

This documentation is a work in progress and it's expected to be updated time to time.

I have come across several online materials and found out that it's better to have easy access to them for reference.

In the field of software developemnt, there are many things to learn and not having a good way to track them for future purpose can be dounting or frustating.

This document will be used to keep track of all types of documents, be it links, downloadable files, videos, or PDF files.
