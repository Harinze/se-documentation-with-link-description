        <h3 class="title">Linux Filesystem Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>This document outlines the set of requirements and guidelines for file and directory placement under the Linux operating system according to those of the FSSTND v2.3 final (January 29, 2004) and also its actual implementation on an arbitrary system. It is meant to be accessible to all members of the Linux community, be distribution independent and is intended to discuss the impact of the FSSTND and how it has managed to increase the efficiency of support interoperability of 
            applications, system administration tools, development tools, and scripts as well as greater uniformity of documentation for these systems.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Linux navigation</h3>
        <p>In this lesson, we will introduce our first three commands: pwd (print working directory), cd (change directory), and ls (list files and directories).

            Those new to the command line will need to pay close attention to this lesson since the concepts will take some getting used to.</p>

        <h3 class="description">Basic vi Commands </h3>
        <p>The default editor that comes with the UNIX operating system is called vi (visual editor). [Alternate editors for UNIX environments include pico and emacs, a product of GNU.]
            The UNIX vi editor is a full screen editor and has two modes of operation:</p>

        <h3 class="title">Shell - Manpage</h3>
        <p>Most of Unix systems are managed by using Shell. Just as you need to know a minimum number of words to have a discussion in a language, you need to know a minimum number of commands to be able to easily interact with a system. Unix systems all have, sometimes with slight differences, the same set of commands. While it is not too hard to remember commands, it might be hard to remember all of their options and how exactly to use them.
             The solution to this is the man command. Letâ€™s go through a part of the ssh one, as there are few elements to know to be able to read a man page:</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html">GNU Emacs Manual</a> calls Emacs the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor, 
            but this description tells beginners little about what Emacs is capable of. To give you an idea, here is a sampling of the things you can do with Emacs:</p>
