        <h3 class="title">Linux Filesystem Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>This document outlines the set of requirements and guidelines for file and directory placement under the Linux operating system according to those of the FSSTND v2.3 final (January 29, 2004) and also its actual implementation on an arbitrary system.

        <h3 class="description">Basic vi Commands </h3>
        <p>The default editor that comes with the UNIX operating system is called vi (visual editor). [Alternate editors for UNIX environments include pico and emacs, a product of GNU.]
