        <h3 class="title">Linux Filesystem Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>This document outlines the set of requirements and guidelines for file and directory placement under the Linux operating system according to those of the FSSTND v2.3 final (January 29, 2004) and also its actual implementation on an arbitrary system. It is meant to be accessible to all members of the Linux community, be distribution independent and is intended to discuss the impact of the FSSTND and how it has managed to increase the efficiency of support interoperability of 
            applications, system administration tools, development tools, and scripts as well as greater uniformity of documentation for these systems.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Linux navigation</h3>
        <p>In this lesson, we will introduce our first three commands: pwd (print working directory), cd (change directory), and ls (list files and directories).

            Those new to the command line will need to pay close attention to this lesson since the concepts will take some getting used to.</p>

        <p>The default editor that comes with the UNIX operating system is called vi (visual editor). [Alternate editors for UNIX environments include pico and emacs, a product of GNU.]
            The UNIX vi editor is a full screen editor and has two modes of operation:</p>

        <h3 class="title">Shell - Manpage</h3>
        <p>Most of Unix systems are managed by using Shell. Just as you need to know a minimum number of words to have a discussion in a language, you need to know a minimum number of commands to be able to easily interact with a system. Unix systems all have, sometimes with slight differences, the same set of commands. While it is not too hard to remember commands, it might be hard to remember all of their options and how exactly to use them.
             The solution to this is the man command. Letâ€™s go through a part of the ssh one, as there are few elements to know to be able to read a man page:</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html" target="_blank">GNU Emacs Manual</a> calls Emacs the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor, 
            but this description tells beginners little about what Emacs is capable of. To give you an idea, here is a sampling of the things you can do with Emacs:</p>

        <h3 class="title">Permissions</h3>
        <p>The Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux differ from other computing systems in that they are not only multitasking but also multi-user.

            What exactly does this mean? It means that more than one user can be operating the computer at the same time. While a desktop or laptop computer only has one keyboard and monitor, it can still be used by more than one user. For example, if the computer is attached to a network, or the Internet, remote users can log in via 
            ssh (secure shell) and operate the computer. In fact, remote users can execute graphical applications and have the output displayed on a remote computer.</p>

        <h3 class="description">Working with Commands</h3>
        <p>Up until now, we have seen a number of commands and their mysterious options and arguments. In this lesson, we will try to remove some of that mystery. We will introduce the following commands.

            type - Display information about command type
            which - Locate a command
            help - Display reference page for shell builtin
            man - Display an on-line command reference</p>
